  title: Why socialism?
  description: >-
    If all labor was directed into proper channels, all the wealth now produced
    could be created in three hours a day, giving work to all and an equitable
    division of the products. The trusts and combines are dividing up the
    millions of wealth they have taken from the producers under the system of
    capitalism. The millionaire today lives in a palace, surrounded by menials,
    and the people who feed, clothe, and supply his wants live in tenements and
    cellars.

        There is no 'boss' in The Appeal. Not a harsh word is spoken. There is a
        smile on every face, kindness in every voice, joy in every heart.

        The work is done as all work should be done - with eagerness and
        enthusiasm.

        The more work the merrier the crowd, and if an emergency arises that
        requires special effort or extra exertion they settle down upon it like
        a swarm of bees and the decks are soon cleared for another attack....

        It is truly mechanism of marvelous magnitude; a miracle of harmonious
        cooperation.

    The Appeal stops for nothing. It never sleeps and it is fed in its flight
    like a meteor....

    There is joy in seeing The Appeal family, for such it is, at their task.

    They work with their heads, hands, and hearts.

    The Appeal to Reason was established at Kansas City, Mo., August 31, 1895.
    It did not have a subscriber. It was moved to Girard, Kan., February. 1897.
    In its growth it is now occupying the fifth building, moving into larger
    quarters each time. The present building was built for it, and is eighty by
    one hundred feet, two stories and basement. It employs an average of sixty
    people and has a weekly payroll exceeding $1,000. It has the finest
    machinery used in the printing business. It is printed on a three-deck,
    straight-line Goss machine that prints four hundred twelve-page papers, in
    colors, folded, per minute, when desired. It has three Mergenthaler
    linotypes, two bookpresses. four jobbers, a book folding machine,  a letter
    folder, cutters, stitchers, etc. Sixteen typewriters are used in the office.
    It has 450,000 subscribers, and the average edition is 550,000 each week,
    including bundle sales.The names of the subscribers occupy 1,400 galleys,
    each 8x24 inches, and requires fifteen tons of linotype metal to set it up.
    It uses a car of paper per issue, has used as many as six cars on special
    editions. Its greatest issue was 3,100,000, printed on March 31, 1906, and
    known as "The Rescue Edition." It printed 25,000,000 in 1908 and paid
    $22,000 postage. It uses a barrel of ink per issue. It has seven editors who
    devote al ltheir time to the matter that goes into it: J.A.Wayland. Fred D.
    Warren, E.V. Debs, G.H. Shoaf, C.L. Phifer, H.G. Creel and Grace D. Brewer.
    This is the largest corps of editors used by any paper of its size in
    America. Each of its twenty-one machines is operated by its individual
    motor, power supplied by municipal light plant. The labor commissioner of
    Kansas reports it as the best plant in Kansas for ventilation, short hours,
    rate of wages and protected machinery. Employees work 47 hours per week, and
    wages range from $6 to $25 per week. The shop is union from top to bottom.
    No one under eighteen years of age will be employed. Placed end to end, the
    papers printed last year would make a ribbon 14,200 miles long and two feet
    wide. The postage paid by the Appeal has given Girard. a town of less than
    3,000 population, free mail delivery, which is the smallest town in the
    United States entitled to this privilege. The receipts of the Girard post
    office are greater than any city in Kansas.
