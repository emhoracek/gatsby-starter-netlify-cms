It employs an average of sixty people and has a weekly payroll exceeding $1,000.

## **High Technology at Enormous Scale**

The _Appeal To Reason_ has the finest machinery used in the printing business. It is printed on a three-deck, straight-line Goss machine that prints four hundred twelve-page papers, in colors, folded, per minute, when desired. It has three Mergenthaler linotypes, two bookpresses, four jobbers, a book folding machine,  a letter folder, cutters, stitchers, etc. Sixteen typewriters are used in the office. Each of its twenty-one machines is operated by its individual motor, power supplied by municipal light plant. 

The _Appeal_ has 450,000 subscribers, and the average edition is 550,000 each week, including bundle sales. The names of the subscribers occupy 1,400 galleys, each 8x24 inches, and requires fifteen tons of linotype metal to set it up. It uses a car of paper per issue, has used as many as six cars on special editions. Its greatest issue was 3,100,000, printed on March 31, 1906, and known as "The Rescue Edition." It printed 25,000,000 in 1908 and paid $22,000 postage. It uses a barrel of ink per issue. 

Placed end to end, the papers printed last year would make a ribbon 14,200 miles long and two feet wide.
